###Description

 Work In Progress lets users can navigate through many available jobs and choose if they are interested by swiping or dragging their jobs from a stack of cards as you can do in a dating app.  They are also given the option of yes and no buttons to confirm or pass on presented jobs.  They also have the ability to save jobs, which will be displayed in a saved jobs page where the user can return to later and see a list of the saved jobs. When users are prompted to sign up they are then re-directed to set up a profile in the profile page.  Users are required to have a user name and password to continue to search for wanted jobs. While logged in, their session details are tracked and their job search information is tracked for information containing to their personal experience.

 The developers used a variety of technoligies to make Work In Progress.
 The front end utilizes HTML and CSS while deploying through HandleBars.js. Also the cards are dynamically shown through Anime.js.
 On the back end API calls and JavaScript were implemented to make transitions from login and sign up pages, to a saved jobs page, as well as when users log out.
